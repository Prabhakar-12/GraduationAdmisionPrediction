🎓 Graduation Admission Prediction

This project predicts a student’s chance of admission to a graduate program using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview

The Graduation Admission Prediction system estimates the probability of getting admitted into a university based on academic and profile-related factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP, LOR, and research experience.
The project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train predictive models.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature           | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Serial No.        | Unique identifier for each student          |
| GRE Score         | Graduate Record Examination score           |
| TOEFL Score       | Test of English as a Foreign Language score |
| University Rating | University ranking (1–5)                    |
| SOP               | Statement of Purpose strength (1–5)         |
| LOR               | Letter of Recommendation strength (1–5)     |
| CGPA              | Undergraduate CGPA                          |
| Research          | Research experience (0 = No, 1 = Yes)       |
| Chance of Admit   | Probability of admission (0 to 1)           |
