 # Graduation Admission Prediction

 This project predicts a student’s chance of admission to a graduate program based on academic and profile-related factors using Machine Learning.
 
 ## Project Overview

 The Graduation Admission Prediction system uses historical student data and machine learning algorithms to estimate the probability of admission into a university.
 It helps students understand how factors like GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP, and research experience influence admission chances.

 ## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Serial No.        | Unique ID for each student                  |
| GRE Score         | Graduate Record Examination score           |
| TOEFL Score       | Test of English as a Foreign Language score |
| University Rating | Rating of the university (1–5)              |
| SOP               | Statement of Purpose strength (1–5)         |
| LOR               | Letter of Recommendation strength (1–5)     |
| CGPA              | Undergraduate CGPA                          |
| Research          | Research experience (0 = No, 1 = Yes)       |
| Chance of Admit   | Probability of admission (0 to 1)           |
